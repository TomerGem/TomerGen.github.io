            <h1>About EnduCloud</h1>
            <h2>
                Prescription, analysis and individualization of <br> physical activity for health and performance
            </h2>
            <p>EnduCloud assist health providers and coaches in the prescription of aerobic physical activity for health and performance based on individualized characteristics and constrains, monitors the response to training, and modifies the activity based on the individual response to the activity. EnduCloud combines advanced analytical tools and machine learning models to analyze the training load, the response to it and performs the required modifications.</p>
            <p>EnduCloud uses information collected by wearable devices throughout the day and during physical activity. This information is integrated with the desires, needs and constraint of the user to generate a personalized physical activity plan tailored to the user. EnduCloud continues to monitor the execution of the program, and by monitoring the stress markers and comparing the expected stress vs. the actual training response adapt the training. </p>
            <p>EnduCloud shall provide multiple modalities meeting the needs of specific populations, all built around a common core. The modalities under development and planned modalities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cardiac rehabilitation under the supervision of authorized health professional</li>
                <li>Recreational athletes with/without coach support</li>
                <li>Active life style with/without coach support</li>
                <li>Oncological patient support under the supervision of authorized health professional</li>
            </ul>
            <p>EnduCloud supports multiple sports, starting with walking & running (indoor & outdoor) and shall later add support for additional endurance sports including cycling (indoor & outdoor), rowing, swimming, cross country sky, multisport (triathlon, duathlon, …) and more. </p>
            <p>EnduCloud is intended to be used primarily in supervised mode by health providers and coaches that shall use EnduCloud to provide higher quality personalized service to their customers. However, EnduCloud also provides a free tier of unsupervised personalized service for the general public, that can be complemented by paid supervision services through the application. </p>
            <p>EnduCloud elaborate database which includes comprehensive information regarding the trainee, the training plan and the trainee response to the plan will be used both for the next stages of EnduCloud’s development and to improve our understanding of physical activity and its physiological impact.  </p>
            <p>Built upon contemporary research body, EnduCloud is incorporating unique innovative tools including:   </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2D multimodal dynamic athlete profiling that is significantly more accurate than the current 1D threshold-based models commonly used </li>
                <li>Load  Stress  Strain triple stage modeling that clearly distinguish between external objective measures to internal subjective measures</li>
                <li>Prefabricated & Automated Training Programs provide the advantages of either individually tailored or generic proven training plan. Automated plans are generated based on the person current state and targets, and a large array of constrains from available and preferable timing to training models </li>
                <li>Adaptive training ensures that with both prefabricated or automated training plan, the plan itself keeps evolving from session to session based on the response to the training plan and unexpected events   </li>
                <li>Integrated Analytical tools & ML/DL Models offer the advantages of both legacy and innovative science based analytical tools, and deeper more innovative models being developed based on the accumulating information within the system  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, EnduCloud supports health providers in prescribing physical activity, monitoring the patient response and adapting accordingly to enhance patients’ health, assisting coaches in delivering better services to more athletes, and empowering people to enhance their wellbeing with regular planned physical activity for health or performance. </p>
            <p>The 2D athlete profiling, innovative analytics and adaptive training provide the most accurate solution to date for the prescription, analysis and individualization of physical activity, potentially with better response and lesser risk. Looking forward, EnduCloud is committed to use the collected data repository for further research and development of more accurate models to deliver a better and more accessible physical activity and making a real impact on the wellbeing and health of millions. </p>
