        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this policy or as required by law.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>EnduCloud site uses cookies. Approving our usage of cookies in accordance with this policy during your first visit to the site allows us to use cookies each time you visit the site.</p>

        <h2>Access data/server log files</h2>
        <p>The provider (or his web space provider) collects data about every access to the offer (so-called server log files). Access data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name of the accessed website</li>
            <li>File, date and time of access</li>
            <li>Transferred data volume</li>
            <li>Notification of successful access</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system of the user</li>
            <li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page)</li>
            <li>IP address and the requesting provider</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The provider uses the log data only for statistical evaluations for the purpose of operation, security and optimization of the offer. However, the provider reserves the right to check the log data retrospectively if there is a justified suspicion of illegal use based on concrete evidence.</p>   

        <h2>Contacting</h2>
        <p>When contacting the provider (for example via contact form or e-mail), the user's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event that follow-up questions arise.</p>

        <h2>Newsletter</h2>
        <p>With the newsletter we inform you about us and our offers.</p>
        <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter, we require a valid email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the email address provided or that the owner agrees to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected. This data is only used for sending the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
        <p>When you register for the newsletter, we save your IP address and the date of registration. This storage serves solely as proof in the event that a third party misuses an email address and registers to receive the newsletter without the knowledge of the authorized party.</p>
        <p>You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the email address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time. The revocation can be made via a link in the newsletters themselves, in your profile area or by sending a message to the contact options above.</p>
        <p>After opening the first confirmation e-mail, which asks you to confirm your subscription to the newsletter again, as well as opening further newsletters, the following information will be sent directly to us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether a mail has been opened by a subscriber</li>
            <li>Whether a link in the mail has been clicked by a subscriber</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is used to improve the newsletter and to better adapt it to the interests of the subscribers.</p>
        <p>The newsletter is sent via the service provider MailChimp, a newsletter distribution platform of the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
        <p>The email addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as their other data described in this notice, are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp may use this data to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the dispatch and presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes in order to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them itself or to pass them on to third parties.</p>
        <p>We trust in the reliability and IT and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified under the US-EU data protection agreement "Privacy Shield" and thus commits itself to comply with EU data protection regulations. Furthermore, we have concluded a "Data-Processing-Agreement" with MailChimp. This is a contract in which MailChimp undertakes to protect the data of our users, to process it on our behalf in accordance with its data protection regulations and, in particular, not to pass it on to third parties. You can view MailChimp's privacy policy here.</p>
        <p>The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the MailChimp server when the newsletter is opened. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected. This information is used for the technical improvement of the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behaviour based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times.</p>
        <p>Statistical surveys also include determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor that of MailChimp to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>

        <h2>Comments and Posts</h2>
        <p>If users leave comments or other contributions, their IP addresses may be stored for 7 days on the basis of our legitimate interests. This is done for our security in case someone leaves illegal content in comments and contributions (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.). In this case we can be prosecuted ourselves for the comment or contribution and are therefore interested in the identity of the author.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we reserve the right, on the basis of our legitimate interests, to process the information provided by users for the purpose of spam detection.</p>
        <p>On the same legal basis, we reserve the right to store users' IP addresses for the duration of surveys and to use cookies to avoid multiple votes.</p>
        <p>The data provided in the context of the comments and contributions will be permanently stored by us until the user objects.</p>

        <h2>Integration of third-party services and content</h2>
        <p>It may happen that third-party content, such as videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites are integrated within this online offer. This always presupposes that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers") are aware of the IP address of the users. Without the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address only for the delivery of the contents. However, we have no influence on this if the third-party providers store the IP address, e.g. for statistical purposes. As far as we are aware of this, we inform the users about it.</p>

        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>This offer uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. "("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on the user's computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website by the user is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
        <p>However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce the user's IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. IP anonymization is active on this website. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate the use of the website by the user, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide the website operator with further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet.</p>
        <p>The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.</p>
        <p>Users can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting their browser software accordingly; however, this offer informs users that in this case they may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent. Users can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to their use of the website (including their IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>
        <p>As an alternative to the browser add-on or within browsers on mobile devices, please click this link to prevent Google Analytics from collecting data within this website in the future (the opt-out only works in this browser and only for this domain). An opt-out cookie is stored on your device. If you delete your cookies in this browser, you must click this link again.</p>
